Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) is a method for identifying the presence, location or nature of objects in sea. It is an underwater equivalent of radar which exploits electromagnetic waves (EM). The fundamental principle behind SONAR is beamforming. This is a signal processing technique used in sensor arrays for directional transmission or reception. 

This process is divided into multiple objectives. 

Objective 1 : Simulate a sine wave + noise in MATLAB and see the effect of SNR on both time domain and frequency domain  
Status      : Done.  
Objective 2 : Simulate the input to a 4 element array  
Status      : Done.  
Objective 3 : Beamforming in the frequency domain. (Narrowband beamformer)  
Status      : Done.  
Objective 4 : Simulate beam pattern by shifting theta  
Status      : Done.  
Objective 5 : Observe the effects of signals of different frequencies on an array designed for a specific frequency  
Status      : Done.  
Objective 6 : Effect of SNR on beampattern  
Status      : Done.  
Objective 7 : Retrieve original signal from beamformed output    
Status      : Done.  
Objective 8 : Simulate broadband beamforming    
Status      : Done.  
Objective 9 : Chebyshev windowing in beamforming  
Status      : Done.  
Any code other than the ones mentioned above : Test code  
Status  : Don't bother

Test_1.py : The python code for learning basic graphing
Test_2.py : Simulating a noisy sine wave
test_3.py : Creating the output of a sensor array picking up the signature of a single frequency target
