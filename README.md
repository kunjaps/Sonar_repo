Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) is a method for identifying the presence, location or nature of objects in sea. It is an underwater equivalent of radar which exploits electromagnetic waves (EM). The fundamental principle behind SONAR is beamforming. This is a signal processing technique used in sensor arrays for directional transmission or reception. 

This process is divided into multiple objectives.
