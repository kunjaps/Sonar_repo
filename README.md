Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) is a method for identifying the presence, location or nature of objects in sea. It is an underwater equivalent of radar which exploits electromagnetic waves (EM). The fundamental principle behind SONAR is beamforming. This is a signal processing technique used in sensor arrays for directional transmission or reception. 

This process is divided into multiple objectives. 

Objective 1 : Simulate a sine wave + noise in MATLAB and see the effect of SNR on both time domain and frequency domain  
Status      : Done.  
Objective 2 : Simulate the input to a 4 element array  
Status      : Done.  
Objective 3 : Beamforming in the frequency domain. (Narrowband beamformer)  
Status      : Done.  
Objective 4 : Simulate beam pattern by shifting theta  
Status      : Done.  
Objective 5 : SIMULATE BEAM PATTERN FOR DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES ON AN ARRAY DESIGNED FOR A CERTAIN FREQUENCY  
Status      : Done.  
Objective 6 : EFFECT OF SNR ON BEAM PATTERN  
Status      : Done.  
Objective 7 : TO GET THE ORIGINAL SIGNAL FROM THE BEAM FORMED OUTPUT  
Status      : Done.  
Objective 8 : SIMULATE BROADBAND BEAMFORMING  
Status      : Done.  
Objective 9 : Apply the chebyshev windowing in beamforming  
Status      : Done.
