Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) in underwater is essential to communicate, detect enemy submarines, torpedoes and many other similar applications.

It is defined as ‘method or equipment for  determining by underwater sound, the presence, location, or nature of objects in sea’. It is an underwater equivalent of radar which exploits electromagnetic (EM) waves for aerospace application, whereas SONAR uses sound waves for hydrospace application. 

The basic principle behind towed array SONAR is beamforming. (Beamforming is one of the basic principles of Sonar)Beamforming is a signal processing technique used in sensor arrays for directional transmission or reception. It works on the principle that there is a delay when a wave front of sound reaches the sensors in the array and as a result there would be a phase difference between the element outputs. 

This report is  simulation of reception beamforming under different conditions and environments and aims to understand the basics of beamforming.
